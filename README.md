## About Me
I'm an aspiring wildlife biologist wanting to apply my skills and experience to engage with others who share my passion of working with wildlife. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Wildlife Conservation Biology at the University of Rhode Island (URI), where I'm currently enrolled in the Master of Environmental Science and Management (MESM) program specializing in Conservation Biology, while working towards a Graduate Certificate in GIS and Remote Sensing. 

While studying at URI I have taken advantage of many opportunities to get involved by volunteering with several organizations on a variety of projects. I'm primarily interested and excited about conducting field work with a diverse array of plant and animal species. Understanding the importance of communicating, I have made sure to hone my abilities as a writer and develop my public speaking skills. I have also made sure to introduce myself to a variety of computer and technological software, including Microsoft, R, GPS, ArcGIS, and ERDAS Imagine by using these programs for projects and assignments in school. I look to leverage my skills and experience into future wildlife positions to promote sound conservation and management.
## Experience
My first job was with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in RI managing breeding populations of piping plovers and least terns. 

The following table shows the several groups I have volunteered with, along with brief descriptions of the work performed. My [LinkedIn account] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-w-brown-7bb512202/) provides greater detail of my professional and volunteer experience.
